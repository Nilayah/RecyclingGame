# RecyclingGame

Our game is a top-down, educational sorting game inspired by the mechanics and design of moving out, stardew valley, and among us. The premise of the game is a kid living with her grandparents that has to help them recycle as one of her chores. The player is a young kid helping their parents with cleaning up the house of all trash and recyclables. Designed for older kids and preteens with the goal to teach the importance of recycling through engaging mechanics, facts and statistics (logos), and storytelling with a message (pathos). The game encourages our players to become more environmentally friendly by recycling more in their daily life.
